# Using CDN for Static Assets in Next.js

## Step 1: Configure Asset Prefix

Next.js provides a way to configure an asset prefix, which allows you to serve your static assets from a CDN. You can set this up in your `next.config.js` file.

### Example Configuration
```javascript name=next.config.js
module.exports = {
  assetPrefix: 'https://cdn.example.com',
};
```

In the example above, replace `'https://cdn.example.com'` with the URL of your CDN.

## Step 2: Update Static Asset Paths

When you configure an asset prefix, Next.js will automatically prepend the prefix to all static asset paths. Ensure that your static assets (such as images, stylesheets, and scripts) are placed in the `public` directory.

### Example Structure
```
my-next-app/
├── public/
│   ├── images/
│   │   └── logo.png
│   └── styles/
│       └── main.css
├── pages/
│   └── index.js
└── next.config.js
```

## Step 3: Deploy Static Assets to CDN

Deploy the contents of your `public` directory to your CDN. The specific steps for this will depend on the CDN provider you are using. Most CDN providers offer a way to upload files via their web interface, CLI, or API.

## Step 4: Reference Static Assets in Your Application

Reference your static assets in your application as usual. Next.js will automatically use the CDN URL for these assets.

### Example Usage in a Component
```jsx name=pages/index.js
import Image from 'next/image';

const HomePage = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome to My Next.js App</h1>
    <Image src="/images/logo.png" alt="Logo" width={200} height={100} />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/main.css" />
  </div>
);

export default HomePage;
```

In the example above, the image and stylesheet will be loaded from the CDN URL configured in `next.config.js`.

## Additional Tips

### Environment Variables

You can use environment variables to manage different asset prefixes for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

```javascript name=next.config.js
module.exports = {
  assetPrefix: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'https://cdn.example.com' : '',
};
```

### Caching

Ensure that your CDN is configured to cache static assets appropriately to improve performance.

### Security

Make sure to configure your CDN with proper security settings, such as HTTPS and access controls, to protect your assets.

By following these steps, you can effectively use a CDN to serve static assets in your Next.js application, resulting in improved load times and better performance.
